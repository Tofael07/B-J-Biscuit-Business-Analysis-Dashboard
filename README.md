# B&J Biscuit Business Analysis Dashboard [Excel]

## Problem Statement: 

B&J Biscuit, a growing consumer goods brand, required a comprehensive and interactive Excel dashboard to uncover actionable insights from their sales data. The business sought a solution that could provide a clear view of revenue distribution, customer behavior, geographic performance, and overall profitability — all in one place.

### The key challenge was to transform raw sales and customer data into a user-friendly dashboard that enables decision-makers to:

- Visualize revenue distribution by product pricing, age group, gender, and payment method.

- Identify high-profit segments, including the most profitable brand, location, customer, and salesperson.

- Track customer acquisition and highlight the top 5 revenue-generating customers.

- Map revenue across geographic regions to spot market opportunities.

- Monitor sales KPIs like quantity sold, total revenue, COGS, and profit in real-time.

- Use interactive filters (e.g., by location, payment method, age group) for customized exploration.

This dashboard was built entirely in Microsoft Excel, with a focus on visual clarity, interactivity, and business impact, empowering the B&J Biscuit team to make faster, data-driven decisions.

## Dashboard Creation Process in Excel

### Data Cleaning & Preparation:

- Raw sales, customer, and transaction data was cleaned using Excel formulas and formatted into structured tables.

### Metric Calculation:

- Used Excel formulas and pivot tables to derive key metrics like profit, COGS, margin, and quantities sold.

### Pivot Tables & Charts:

- Created multiple pivot tables to summarize data by age group, gender, location, product type, etc.

- Visualized data using bar charts, pie charts, and KPI cards.

### Dashboard Design:

- Organized visuals using consistent layout and color scheme (aligned with ColorHunt recommendations).

- Added slicers for filters (age group, payment method, location) for interactivity.

### User Interface Enhancements:

- Included dynamic toggle between percentage vs. absolute view.

- Highlighted KPIs at the top for quick performance snapshots.

## Dashboard Insights:
### Top Performers

- Top Salesperson: Travis Doyle

- Most Profitable Customer: Robert Hernandez (contributing 45.6% of revenue among top 5)

- Most Profitable Location: San Antonio (11.9% of revenue)

- Most Profitable Product: Shortbread

- Most Profitable Age Group: 60–74

These figures highlight who and what drives the highest revenue, helping prioritize retention and focus efforts on top-performing segments.

### Revenue & Profitability 

- Total Revenue: $61.5M

- Total Profit: $26.7M

- COGS: $34.8M

- Profit Margin: 44%

This healthy margin suggests pricing and cost strategies are working well overall.

### Revenue by Price Type

- 90% of the revenue comes from high-priced products, indicating customers prefer premium offerings and that the brand’s pricing strategy is effective.

### Revenue by Customer Demographics

- Gender Split: Male customers dominate at 84.4%, while females contribute only 9.5% of revenue.

- Age Group: The majority of revenue is evenly distributed across age brackets 30–74, with the 60–74 group being the most profitable.

This suggests potential to increase engagement with female customers and the 15–29 and 75–89 age segments, which show lower performance.

### Revenue by Geography

- San Antonio, San Jose, Philadelphia, and Houston are the top contributors. However, there’s a fairly even spread among cities, implying room for targeted growth in lower-performing areas like Phoenix or Chicago.

### Revenue by Payment Method

- Revenue is evenly split across payment methods (Cash, Credit Card, Debit Card, Mobile Payment), which shows versatility in customer preferences. Promotions could be aligned with specific payment types to increase usage.

## Recommendations

### Double Down on High-Performing Segments:

- Incentivize top salespersons and engage top customers (e.g., loyalty rewards for Robert Hernandez).

- Prioritize promotions in San Antonio and for Shortbread products.

### Target Underrepresented Groups:

- Design marketing campaigns to attract female customers and the younger (15–29) and older (75–89) age groups.

- Consider product customization or bundled offers tailored for these groups.

### Explore Underperforming Locations:

- Investigate the reasons behind lower sales in cities like Phoenix and Chicago.

- Launch localized campaigns to boost awareness and adoption.

### Leverage Data for Retargeting:

- Use demographic and geographic filters for more personalized marketing strategies and sales forecasting.
